Project to practice the use of React Native in a supposed real project to develop. Also to use the framework's own components such as:
- View
- Text
- Pressable
- ImageBackground
- StyleSheet
- Dimensions
- SafeAreaView
- StatusBar

All these are essential tools for our work as mobile application developers.
